## Why use Ano.js?
Ano.js was designed to be simple. Our team develops and formats the animations, so the user can use it in their website just by copy-pasting two lines of code! Instead of Anime.js and Mo.js where you have to code and create the animation yourself, we just did it for you!

## What do Ano.js contributors do?
Ano.js contributors are in charge to creating web animations and deploying it for users to use. It is a great way to improve your skills while also being a part of a strong team.

## Why should I contribute?
<b> All animations that you create give you recognition. </b> The more contributions you make, the higher you will be ranked on the [Ano.js team page](https://anojs.com/our-team). Each animation you create will have your name next to it, we track how many people use your animations, and the more active you are the higher chance it is for you to be contacted for a staff position at Ano.js.

<b> All of the work you do here is up to you. </b> There are absolutely no time or effort commitments being a contributor. You can do as much or as little as you want as a contributor. But, more active contributors get to reap the rewards of being active.

<b> We try to make your job as easy as possible. </b> There are a lot of rules to follow when formatting animations for open use. Instead of you doing it, we've taken the responsibility of formatting your animations for you. You worry about making the animations, and we'll take care of the rest.
