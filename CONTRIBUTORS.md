## What do contributors do?
Ano.js contributors will create web animations themselves and deploy them so users can use them. These animations, if accepted, will be deployed to our main website anojs.com and be open for users to freely use them!


## Assessing your skill level
You don't need to know how to code to be a contributor. But, in order to contribute properly, you should learn some basic skills. Here are the skills you will need to be able to contribute a huge amount to Ano.js:
- Basic HTML/CSS
- Good grasp of Javascript - this repo is written in plain javascript
- Basic Git/GitHub skills
  - Pushing/pulling from a repository
  - Making pull requests

If you don't have some of these skills, please view the links below - these are links to tutorials for every skill listed above, so you can start coding ASAP!

- [Git/GitHub Crash Course for Absolute Beginners (30 mins)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWYqp7iY_Tc) <br/>


## Creating web animations
Ano.js supports animations created with three different technologies:
- HTML5 Canvas (Beginner)
  - Good at making simple animations like shapes bouncing around a screen
  - EXAMPLES: [HTML5 Canvas Animations](https://cloudinary.com/blog/creating_html5_animations)
- Mo.js (Intermediate)
  - Good at making interactive animations that can animate on click or hover
  - EXAMPLE: [Mo.js Click Effect](https://codepen.io/sdras/pen/kkqNYK)
- Anime.js (Hard)
  - Good at everything!
  - Especially good at ripple, staggering, and SVG effects
  - EXAMPLES: [Anime.js](https://codepen.io/collection/XLebem/)

These technologies have been labelled with their difficulty level, what type of animation they're good at creating, along with some examples to see what has been done with each. Please pick the technology level that suits you best. Remember, all three technologies can create some amazing web animations!

<b> NOTE: Some of these tutorials use Codepen.io, but in order to contribute to Ano.js, you must do it in a .js file. See [CONTRIBUTION-GUIDELINES.md](CONTRIBUTION-GUIDELINES.md) for more details. </b>

## Contribution Process
The way to contribute to Ano.js is very simple:
1. Create a web animation
    - Make whatever you want, you're the boss!
2. Open a pull request
    - We will take a look at your animation. We will assess the following
      - Does the animation work?
      - Is it formatted properly?
      - Is it original?
4. Wait!
    - If your pull request is accepted, your animation will be deployed directly (with your name on it) to the website and users can start using it!
    - If your pull request is rejected, we will specifically tell you why so you can fix it and make another pull request.
